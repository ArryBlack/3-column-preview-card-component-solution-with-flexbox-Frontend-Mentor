## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt the use of breakpoints and media queries, although I chosea desktop-first approach for this problem.

### Continued development

I used a desktop-first approach for creating this layout, in the future I would like to focus on mobile-first approaches, maybe on a second solution of this layout.

### Useful Resources

Kevin Powell's free conquering responsive layouts challenge has been really helpful.
